<analysis>
The previous AI engineer developed an asset inventory app for a maintenance team. The work began with clarifying detailed product requirements, including specific features for materials, tools, QR code generation/scanning, stock take, and user roles. The development followed a phased plan: Foundation, QR Code System, Stock Take, and Advanced Features.

Throughout the trajectory, the AI engineer incrementally built the frontend (Expo/React Native) and backend (FastAPI/MongoDB). Key implementations included user authentication with PIN login, role-based access, a supervisor dashboard, inventory management, a stock-take workflow, QR scanner integration, and bulk item upload with photo capture and QR sticker generation.

Multiple iterations of testing and bug fixing occurred, with the user reporting critical layout, scrolling, navigation, and camera functionality issues that the AI's internal testing missed. The AI acknowledged these failures and fixed them. The most recent major addition was a comprehensive auto error detection and reporting system.

Currently, the AI is working on implementing a supplier management system as requested by the user, having just created the frontend file for it.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an asset inventory mobile app for the Chimes Shopping Centre maintenance team (5 members: 2 supervisors, 3 engineers). The app needs to:
- Monitor stock materials and tools using QR codes generated within the app.
- Provide a stock take feature.
- Be simple, visually clear, and button-driven, with minimal text, for all ages.
- Be optimized for Samsung Android phones, but also work on iPhone and tablets.

**Materials:** Basic details, supplier information, low stock alerts (supervisors), item photos.
**Tools:** Basic details, service records, check-in/check-out system, condition tracking, item photos.
**QR Code Functionality:** Generate unique QR codes for all items (containing ID & basic info), print-ready stickers (QR, short details, thumbnail), scan items for quantity updates (take/restock materials, check-in/out tools).
**Stock Take:** Simple flow for scanning each item, inputting quantity for materials, and quantity + condition for tools.
**User Roles:** Supervisors (Lee & Dan Carter) have full access, including settings and adjustments. Engineers (Lee Paull, Dean Turnill, Luis) have a simplified interface for using items and performing stock takes.
**Requested Enhancements:**
- **For Supervisors:** Smart Dashboard (health score, priorities, activity feed, weekly summary, budget alerts), Quick Actions (emergency reorder, staff check-in, instant approval, voice notes, photo problem reports), Predictive Intelligence (reorder suggestions, maintenance alerts, cost savings, seasonal reminders, usage analysis).
- **For Engineers:** One-Tap Operations (quick take buttons, favorite items, tool buddy, break/lunch mode, end-of-day checkout), Smart Mobile Features (offline mode, voice commands, flashlight integration, vibration feedback, big button mode), Helpful Shortcuts (location breadcrumbs, similar items, quick notes, weather integration, battery alerts).
- **Universal Team Features:** Auto-return reminders, smart photo recognition, geofence alerts, time-based suggestions, weather-smart alerts, tool handoff, shift notes, help request, training reminders, achievement badges, simple reporting (photo evidence, incident reports, damage tracking, usage certificates, end-of-month summary).
- **Standout Simple Features:** Tool finder, replacement alerts, supplier speed dial, digital tool tags, emergency override.
- **Innovation Opportunities:** Smartwatch/NFC/Apple/Google Wallet/Siri/Google Assistant/WhatsApp integration.
- **Security:** Simple PIN-based login to prevent unauthorized account usage.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive auto error detection system with friendly user messages and automatic reporting to the developer.
- **Supplier Management:** Store suppliers, what they sell, product numbers for items, potentially AI scanning company websites for product codes. All features should be interconnected.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of implementing a comprehensive **supplier management system** into the application. This feature aims to store details about suppliers, the products they sell, and their respective product numbers, facilitating easy reordering for the maintenance team.

Specifically, the AI had just created the frontend file  to serve as the screen for this new feature. The next immediate step planned was to develop the corresponding **backend API endpoints** in  to handle data storage and retrieval for suppliers and their associated products. Following that, the plan was to integrate **navigation** to this new  screen from the main application interface, likely from the supervisor's dashboard or settings.

This work follows a series of significant enhancements, including a secure PIN-based login, a smart supervisor dashboard with real-time alerts and activity feeds, one-tap operations for engineers, a robust QR code scanning system (fixed for cross-platform compatibility), and a bulk inventory upload feature with photo capture and QR sticker generation. Most recently, a comprehensive auto error detection and reporting system was implemented, making the app more resilient. The app currently supports user roles (supervisors/engineers), stock management, and stock take functionality.
