The previous AI engineer successfully initiated an asset inventory app, building core functionalities like user authentication, role-based access, inventory management, QR scanning, and a robust error reporting system. Significant features such as a comprehensive supplier management system (including AI-powered website scanning) and a full delivery logging system (with AI note processing, photo capture, and manual input) were implemented and tested on the backend.

However, the development faced recurring challenges, particularly with frontend UI/UX. The supplier management module encountered multiple issues with form clearing, duplicate prevention, and AI product display, leading to several debugging cycles and credit usage, eventually necessitating a  to identify root causes. A large-scale accessibility overhaul was attempted but resulted in dependency conflicts and compilation errors, requiring a complete rollback to stabilize the application.

Currently, the core application features are functional, including new manual input options for scanner and stock-take. The AI is focused on resolving a critical frontend issue: the Log Delivery button is not visible on the supervisor dashboard, and navigation to the  screen is not working as expected, indicating a persistent rendering or routing problem.

The objective is an asset inventory mobile app for the Chimes Shopping Centre maintenance team (5 members: 2 supervisors, 3 engineers). It must monitor materials and tools using in-app generated QR codes and provide stock-taking features. The app needs to be simple, visually clear, button-driven, and accessible to all ages, optimized for Android but cross-platform.

Key features include: managing material and tool details, supplier information, low stock alerts, service records, check-in/check-out systems, photo capture, and unique QR code generation for items. Stock-take involves scanning items and inputting quantities/conditions. User roles (supervisors, engineers) dictate access levels. Security relies on PIN-based login. The app must have an auto error detection and reporting system.

Recent enhancements involved: a Smart Dashboard for supervisors (health score, priorities, quick actions), One-Tap Operations for engineers (quick take, favorites), and universal features like smart photo recognition. A comprehensive **Supplier Management** system was implemented to store supplier details, products, and product numbers, with AI scanning of websites. A **Delivery Logging System** was also fully implemented, allowing all users to log deliveries, take photos of delivery notes, use AI for data extraction and stock update suggestions (user-confirmed), manual input alternatives, full audit logging, and universal search capabilities. Future requirements include full offline functionality and a comprehensive accessibility overhaul for users with vision challenges (e.g., large text, high contrast, voice commands), though the latter was partially implemented and reverted due to issues.

<pending_tasks>
- Re-implement accessibility features incrementally and stably.
- Implement comprehensive offline functionality for the entire app.
- Debug and fix the display issue for the Log Delivery button on the supervisor dashboard.
- Ensure the supplier tick button properly clears the form after submission.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently focused on a critical UI/UX issue: the Log Delivery button is not displaying correctly on the supervisor dashboard, and consequently, navigation to the  screen is not functioning as expected. Initial investigation confirmed the deliveries button is present in the  code and the  file exists and is included in the main layout ().

The AI previously identified and fixed an authentication inconsistency where the  screen was using a different  key () than the dashboard (), causing it to incorrectly redirect to the login page. While this fix addressed the redirection, screenshots still show only 4 of the expected 6 supervisor quick action buttons, with the Log Delivery button visibly missing. This suggests a rendering or layout problem within the dashboard's  section, potentially related to content cutting off or incorrect conditional rendering. The AI is now re-examining the dashboard code to understand why only four buttons are showing.
